    <h2>My Favorite 1-Ingredient Swap for the Best Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Ricotta is a traditional choice when it comes to many Italian American dishes, but swapping in cottage cheese might actually make your next lasagna even better.</p>
    <p>Cottage cheese has a reputation as a ho-hum diet food, but its mild taste and light texture make it an excellent choice for baked pasta dishes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
