    <h2>Bierock Salad</h2>
    <p>This bierock salad is a Germany-meets-Midwest salad bowl tribute to the hyper-regional handheld sandwich. Ground beef, sauerkraut, cabbage, and easy, yeasty croutons put the bierock in a salad bowl.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>4 frozen yeast rolls, or more as desired, such as Sister Schubert®</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Everything But the Bagel seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>1 (14.4 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet, breaking it up into small pieces, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onions and Worcestershire sauce. Cook and stir until beef is browned and onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Set frozen yeast rolls on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Cut cooled rolls into crouton-sized pieces. Melt butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. Place bread pieces into a bowl and pour melted butter evenly over the top. Sprinkle buttered roll pieces with 1 tablespoon Everything seasoning. Shake bowl to distribute seasoning and butter evenly. Spread bread pieces on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake croutons in the preheated oven until croutons are dry and crunchy, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>To assemble salad, place drained sauerkraut in the bottom of a large bowl. Add cabbage, vinegar, sugar, mustard, remaining 1 tablespoon Everything seasoning, and shredded Cheddar. Mix in cooled hamburger mixture until well combined. </li>
        <li>Serve in individual bowls and top with croutons.</li>
